Nhưng khổ nỗi, đồng hồ quả lắc ngày xưa cứ mang lên tàu rung lắc là chạy sai hết. Bài này kể về hành trình chế tạo ra chiếc đồng hồ đi biển đầu tiên, thứ đã cứu mạng hàng ngàn thủy thủ.",
        "text": """
Up to the middle of the 18th century, the navigators were still unable to exactly identify the position at sea, so they might face a great number of risks such as the shipwreck or running out of supplies before arriving at the destination. Knowing one’s position on the earth requires two simple but essential coordinates, one of which is the longitude.

The longitude is a term that can be used to measure the distance that one has covered from one’s home to another place around the world without the limitations of naturally occurring baseline like the equator. To determine longitude, navigators had no choice but to measure the angle with the naval sextant between Moon centre and a specific star— lunar distance—along with the height of both heavenly bodies. Together with the nautical almanac, Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) was determined, which could be adopted to calculate longitude because one hour in GMT means 15-degree longitude. Unfortunately, this approach laid great reliance on the weather conditions, which brought great inconvenience to the crew members. Therefore, another method was proposed, that is, the time difference between the home time and the local time served for the measurement.

Theoretically, knowing the longitude position was quite simple, even for the people in the middle of the sea with no land in sight. The key element for calculating the distance travelled was to know, at the very moment, the accurate home time. But the greatest problem is: how can a sailor know the home time at sea?

The simple and again obvious answer is that one takes an accurate clock with him, which he sets to the home time before leaving. A comparison with the local time (easily identified by checking the position of the Sun) would indicate the time difference between the home time and the local time, and thus the distance from home was obtained. The truth was that nobody in the 18th century had ever managed to create a clock that could endure the violent shaking of a ship and the fluctuating temperature while still maintaining the accuracy of time for navigation.

After 1714, as an attempt to find a solution to the problem, the British government offered a tremendous amount of £20,000, which were to be managed by the magnificently named ‘Board of Longitude’. If timekeeper was the answer (and there could be other proposed solutions, since the money wasn’t only offered for timekeeper), then the error of the required timekeeping for achieving this goal needed to be within 2.8 seconds a day, which was considered impossible for any clock or watch at sea, even when they were in their finest conditions.

This award, worth about £2 million today, inspired the self-taught Yorkshire carpenter John Harrison to attempt a design for a practical marine clock. In the later stage of his early career, he worked alongside his younger brother James. The first big project of theirs was to build a turret clock for the stables at Brockelsby Park, which was revolutionary because it required no lubrication. Harrison designed a marine clock in 1730, and he travelled to London in seek of financial aid. He explained his ideas to Edmond Halley, the Astronomer Royal, who then introduced him to George Graham, Britain’s first-class clockmaker. Graham provided him with financial aid for his early-stage work on sea clocks. It took Harrison five years to build Harrison Number One or HI. Later, he sought the improvement from alternate design and produced H4 with the giant clock appearance. Remarkable as it was, the Board of Longitude wouldn’t grant him the prize for some time until it was adequately satisfied.

Harrison had a principal contestant for the tempting prize at that time, an English mathematician called John Hadley, who developed sextant. The sextant is the tool that people adopt to measure angles, such as the one between the Sun and the horizon, for a calculation of the location of ships or planes. In addition, his invention is significant since it can help determine longitude.

Most chronometer forerunners of that particular generation were English, but that doesn’t mean every achievement was made by them. One wonderful figure in the history is the Lancastrian Thomas Earnshaw, who created the ultimate form of chronometer escapement—the spring detent escapement—and made the final decision on format and productions system for the marine chronometer, which turns it into a genuine modem commercial product, as well as a safe and pragmatic way of navigation at sea over the next century and half.

        "status": "Active",
        "title": "Australian Agricultural Innovations: 1850 – 1900",
        "intro_text": "Làm nông nghiệp ở Úc khó hơn nhiều so với ở Anh hay châu Âu vì đất đai ở đây rất khô và thiếu dinh dưỡng. Vào cuối thế kỷ 19, những người nông dân Úc đứng trước nguy cơ phá sản vì các phương pháp canh tác cũ không còn hiệu quả.\nBài đọc này sẽ cho các bạn thấy họ đã xoay sở như thế nào bằng công nghệ.

        "text": """
During this period, there was a widespread expansion of agriculture in Australia. The selection system was begun, whereby small sections of land were parceled out by lot. Particularly in New South Wales, this led to conflicts between small holders and the emerging squatter class, whose abuse of the system often allowed them to take vast tracts of fertile land.

There were also many positive advances in farming technology as the farmers adapted agricultural methods to the harsh Australian conditions. One of the most important was “dry farming”. This was the discovery that repeated ploughing of fallow, unproductive land could preserve nitrates and moisture, allowing the land to eventually be cultivated. This, along with the extension of the railways, allowed the development of what are now great inland wheat lands.

The inland areas of Australia are less fertile than most other wheat-producing countries and yields per acre are lower. This slowed their development, but also led to the development of several labour saving devices. In 1843 John Ridley, a South Australian farmer, invented “the stripper”, a basic harvesting machine. By the 1860s its use was widespread. H. V. McKay, then only nineteen, modified the machine so that it was a complete harvester: cutting, collecting and sorting. McKay developed this early innovation into a large harvester manufacturing industry centred near Melbourne and exporting worldwide. Robert Bowyer Smith invented the “stump jump plough”, which let a farmer plough land which still had tree stumps on it. It did this by replacing the traditional plough shear with a set of wheels that could go over stumps, if necessary.

The developments in farm machinery were supported by scientific research. During the late 19th century, South Australian wheat yields were declining. An agricultural scientist at the colony’s agricultural college, John Custance, found that this was due to a lack of phosphates and advised the use of soluble superphosphate fertilizer. The implementation of this scheme revitalised the industry.

From early days it had been obvious that English and European sheep breeds had to be adapted to Australian conditions, but only near the end of the century was the same applied to crops. Prior to this, English and South African strains had been use, with varying degrees of success. WilliamFarrer, from Cambridge University, was the first to develop new wheat varieties that were better able to withstand dry Australian conditions. By 1914, Australia was no longer thought of as a land suitable only for sheep, but as a wheat-growing nation.

                    ### 1. CÁC LỖI TƯ DUY LOGIC CẦN TRÁNH 
                    Đây là các lỗi lập luận phổ biến do ảnh hưởng của tư duy dịch từ tiếng Việt hoặc văn hóa giao tiếp hàng ngày, cần loại bỏ trong văn viết học thuật:

                    **⚠️ Hasty Generalization (Khái quát hóa vội vã)**
                    * **Bản chất:** Sử dụng các từ chỉ sự tuyệt đối (*All, Always, Everyone, Nobody*) dựa trên định kiến hoặc quan sát hẹp, thiếu tính khách quan.
                    * **Ví dụ sai:** "Graduates **always** find it hard to get a job." (Sinh viên tốt nghiệp luôn khó tìm việc -> Sai sự thật).
                    * **Khắc phục (Hedging):** Sử dụng ngôn ngữ rào đón để đảm bảo tính chính xác.
                    * **Sửa:** "It can be challenging for **many** fresh graduates to secure employment."

                    **⚠️ Slippery Slope (Trượt dốc phi logic)**
                    * **Bản chất:** Suy diễn một chuỗi hậu quả cực đoan từ một nguyên nhân ban đầu mà thiếu các mắt xích logic trung gian. Lỗi này thường gặp khi người viết muốn nhấn mạnh hậu quả nhưng lại cường điệu hóa quá mức.
                    * **Ví dụ sai:** "Playing video games leads to dropping out of school, which results in becoming a criminal." (Chơi game -> Bỏ học -> Tội phạm).
                    * **Khắc phục:** Chỉ đề cập đến hệ quả trực tiếp và có tính khả thi cao nhất.
                    * **Sửa:** "Excessive gaming may **negatively impact academic performance** due to a lack of focus."

                    **⚠️ Circular Reasoning (Lập luận luẩn quẩn)**
                    * **Bản chất:** Giải thích một vấn đề bằng cách lặp lại vấn đề đó với từ ngữ khác, không cung cấp thêm thông tin hay lý do sâu sắc (Why/How).
                    * **Ví dụ sai:** "Air pollution is harmful because it has bad effects on humans." (*Harmful* và *Bad effects* là tương đương -> Không giải thích được gì).
                    * **Khắc phục:** Triển khai ý bằng nguyên nhân cụ thể hoặc cơ chế tác động.
                    * **Sửa:** "Air pollution is detrimental as it **directly contributes to respiratory diseases** such as asthma."

                    ### 2. TIÊU CHUẨN CẤU TRÚC ĐOẠN VĂN (MÔ HÌNH P.E.E.R)
                    Mỗi đoạn văn (Body Paragraph) cần tuân thủ cấu trúc chặt chẽ để đảm bảo tính mạch lạc:
                    

                    * **P - Point (Topic Sentence):** Câu chủ đề nêu luận điểm chính trực tiếp, ngắn gọn. Tránh lối viết "mở bài gián tiếp" vòng vo.
                    * **E - Explanation (Elaboration):** Giải thích lý do tại sao luận điểm đó đúng. Đây là phần quan trọng nhất thể hiện tư duy (Critical Thinking).
                    * **E - Example (Evidence):** Đưa ra ví dụ cụ thể, điển hình (không lấy ví dụ cá nhân chủ quan).
                    * **R - Result/Link:** Câu chốt, khẳng định lại ý nghĩa của luận điểm đối với câu hỏi đề bài.

                    ### 3. TÍNH MẠCH LẠC & PHÁT TRIỂN Ý (COHERENCE & PROGRESSION)
                    
                    **Depth over Breadth (Chiều sâu hơn Chiều rộng):**
                    * **Lỗi thường gặp:** Liệt kê quá nhiều ý ("Firstly, Secondly, Thirdly...") nhưng mỗi ý chỉ viết sơ sài. Điều này khiến bài viết trở thành một bản danh sách (list) hơn là một bài luận (essay).
                    * **Giải pháp:** Trong một đoạn văn, chỉ nên chọn 1 đến 2 ý tưởng đắt giá nhất và phát triển chúng trọn vẹn theo mô hình P.E.E.R.

                    **Linear Thinking (Tư duy tuyến tính):**
                    * Đảm bảo dòng chảy thông tin đi theo đường thẳng: **A dẫn đến B, B dẫn đến C**.
                    * Tránh tư duy đường vòng hoặc nhảy cóc (nhắc đến kết quả D mà không giải thích quá trình B và C).

                                   - If the user says "I go school" (missing 'to'), WRITE "I go school".
                                   - If the user mispronounces "think" as "sink", WRITE "sink" (or "tink").
                                   - If the user misses final sounds (e.g., "five" -> "fi"), WRITE "fi".
                                3. The transcript MUST reflect the raw performance so the user can see their mistakes.
